Our application consists of three parts: database (mongodb), backend (express, node) and frontend (react).
Please refer to the READMEs of backend and frontend on how to set them up initially.

Once you set up everything, you can run refer to the quick start guide.

npm start
```

To get an impression of the design and the structure of our application, we provided some screenshots and a short description here.

As our application targets vehicle owners as well as district administratives/representatives and our use cases
are at the intersection of both of them, we strove to create an application that serves both

# For vehicle owners
The login for vehicle owners is reachable at "/login".
After a succesful registration and login, you need to verify yourself.
Disclaimer: We tried to mock the verification process as best as possible. In this step, we try to recognize the users name on his personal ID. In case it fails or takes too long, we provided the possibility to skip the verification by pressing a button on the bottom right (hint: the button is invisibl,e but clickable. After clicking it, you will be navigated to the dashboard).

Then you can access the dashoard:

From here, you can add your vehicle with all its information, and then start a registration or deregistration process.

In case you would like to register your vehicle, make sure to reserve a license plate before starting the registration process.

After succesfully completing a process form and paying, a district administrative may approve your process.
You can track the status of your process in the vehicle dashboard.

# For districts
The login for districts is available at "/districtLogin".
Note that it is not possible to register your district on your own. 
Please contact us via Mail (mikefrommykfz@gmail.com) to create an account for your district!

After you received the login credentials, you can login to the district dashboard.
Here you can see all the vehicle administration processes concerning your district and approve or reject them.
Once you approved/rejected a process, the vehicle owner will be notified via Mail.
